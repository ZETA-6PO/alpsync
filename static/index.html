        My project aims to create an innovative web platform, providing an eco-friendly alternative to traditional file-sharing services such as Dropbox or WeTransfer. The platform will allow users to share files while receiving an estimation of the carbon cost associated with their sharing. This unique feature will raise awareness among users about the environmental footprint of their digital actions and encourage more sustainable practices.
        </p>
        <p>
        To give you a more precise idea: the platform will consist of a single page on which all the main functions will be available. You'll then be able to upload one or more files for a certain period of time, ranging from 1 hour to several weeks. Before uploading, the platform will give you an estimate of the carbon cost of the operation, based on calculations and reference data. Finally, once you've uploaded your files, you'll be given a link to share with others so that they can download them. 
        </p>
        <p>On the technical side, the application will be equipped with a simple API and a database to ensure its smooth operation. The database will store user data securely and efficiently, ensuring a seamless user experience while adhering to privacy regulations. Additionally, the platform will employ encryption protocols to safeguard user data and ensure secure file transmission, further enhancing user confidence in the platform's reliability and security.</p>
        <p>
        By integrating environmental metrics into the file-sharing process, my project aims to promote the reduction of carbon emissions associated with digital activities, thereby contributing to the fight against climate change and the preservation of our planet for future generations.
